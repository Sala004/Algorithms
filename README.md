## Overview
In this repo, I'm tracking my progress on my journey to learn and master algorithms, and I'm also sharing my solutions with others.

## Resources
There are two approaches to studying algorithms: the academic and the practical. During my journey, I aimed to combine both. Below are two courses that were invaluable to me:

- [Introduction to Algorithms by MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
- [Algorithms Part II by Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/)

These courses offer well-structured academic content from prestigious universities, and I applied what I learned by solving various problems.
