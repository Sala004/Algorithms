# Algorithms

This repository contains detailed documentation of the problems I solved throughout my journey of studying algorithms, one of the core principles of computer science. I am sharing my solutions to contribute to the learning community and provide insights into different algorithmic approaches.

Additionally, I recommend the following courses that were invaluable during my learning process:

- [Introduction to Algorithms by MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
- [Algorithms Part II by Princeton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/)
